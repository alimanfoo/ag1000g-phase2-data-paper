Phase 2 


**Abstract**

MalariaGen in a data sharing network that enables groups around the world to the use genomic tools to study malaria disease and transmission.

Here we describe a new release of curated whole genome variation data on 1142 malaria vector mosquito 
sampling from 16 populations in 13 sub-Saharan African countries as part of Phase 2 of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project.

High-quality genotype calls on ~58 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were produced using a standardised analysis pipeline.

Investigations into population structure and genetic diversity highlight medically relevant demographic features differentiated between geographic regions.

For example the island populations, novel to Phase 2 reveal divergent evolutionary histories, high diversity and low Tajima's D in Bioko island samples but the inverse in those from the island of
 Mayotte.

Differentiation between the two species sampled here, Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii, was also uncovered.

An. coluzzii was found to have stronger population structure and therefore potentially lower dispersal than An. gambiae, a result highly relevant to the success of cas-9 mediated 
gene-drive vector control.

Most populations show evidence of at least one mode of resistance to insecticides, with @@nn samples carrying at least one potential resistance allele.

As expected, markers in the Vgsc gene for target-site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides were widespread, however we also show that many individuals also carry potential markers for 
metabolic resistance to pyrethoids.

These results can inform national malaria control program (NMCP) roll-out of next-generation cytochrome P450 synergist bednets, which provide increased protection in the presence of pyrethroid 
metabolic resistance, and more generally demonstrate the power of these genomic datasets in the fight against malaria.

By continually enlarging this open dataset of mosquito genomes, we aim to accelerate research into medically important aspects of vector evolution and the development of an insecticide
resistance monitoring framework required for malaria elimination.
