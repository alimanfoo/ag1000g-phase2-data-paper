Phase 2 


**Abstract**

MalariaGen is a data sharing network that enables groups around the world to the use genomic tools to study malaria disease and transmission.

Here we describe a new release of curated whole-genome variation data on 1,142 malaria vector mosquitoes, 
sampling from 16 populations in 13 sub-Saharan African countries as part of Phase 2 of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project.

High-quality genotype calls on ~58 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were produced using a standardised analysis pipeline.

The expanded sampling of the Phase 2 data set allowed investigations into population structure and genetic diversity which highlight medically relevant demographic features differentiated between geographic regions.

For example the island populations, novel to Phase 2 reveal divergent evolutionary histories, high diversity and low Tajima's D in Bioko island samples but the inverse in those from the island of
 Mayotte.

Important differentiation between the two species sampled here, Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii, was also uncovered.

An. coluzzii was found to have stronger population structure and therefore potentially lower dispersal than An. gambiae, a result highly relevant to the success of cas-9 mediated 
gene-drive vector control.

Most populations show evidence of at least one mode of resistance to insecticides, with @@nn samples carrying at least one potential resistance allele.

As expected, markers in the Vgsc gene for target-site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides were widespread, however we also show that many individuals also carry potential markers for 
metabolic resistance to pyrethoids.

These results can inform national malaria control program (NMCP) roll-out of next-generation cytochrome P450 synergist bednets, which provide increased protection in the presence of 
pyrethroid metabolic resistance, and more generally demonstrate the power of large genomic datasets in the fight against malaria.

By continually enlarging this open dataset of mosquito genomes, we aim to accelerate research into medically important aspects of vector evolution and the development of an insecticide
resistance monitoring framework required for malaria elimination.



**Introduction**

-lifted entirely from DK intro
A major obstacle to malaria elimination is the great capacity of the parasite and vector populations to evolve in response to malaria control interventions. 

The widespread use of chloroquine and DDT in the 1950â€™s led to high levels of drug and insecticide resistance, and the same pattern has been repeated for other 
first-line antimalarial drugs and insecticides.

Over the past 15 years, mass distribution of pyrethroid-treated bednets in Africa and worldwide use of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) initially led to substantial
reductions in malaria prevalence and mortality, but the rate of progress has now tailed off, with rising levels of ACT resistance in Southeast Asian parasites and 
of pyrethroid resistance in African mosquitoes. 

A deep understanding of local patterns of resistance and the continually changing nature of the local parasite and vector populations is necessary to
manage the use of drugs and insecticides and to deploy public health resources for maximum sustainability and impact.

Currently, the surveillance of insecticide resistance in natural vector populations in achieved via insecticide bottle/tube assays (e.g. WHO) and molecular (PCR/TaqMan)
 of known resistance loci. Running insecticide assay on living mosquitoes samples, bred from natural populations provides an almost real-time (one generation removed) picture of the
resistance landscape and all insecticides (that are soluble) can be tested with no prior knowledge of their mechanisms. However, this approach requires much effort, training and
buildings with the capacity for environmental control (humidity/temperature/light) to enable the breeding of enough F1 females for testing.
