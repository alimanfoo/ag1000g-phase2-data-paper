Phase 2 


**Abstract**

MalariaGen in a data sharing network that enables groups around the world to the use genomic tools to study malaria disease and transmission.

Here we describe a new release of curated whole genome variation data on 1142 malaria vector mosquito 
samples from 16 populations in 13 sub-Saharan African countries as phase 2 of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project.

High-quality genotype calls on ~58 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were produced using a standardised analysis pipeline.

~~something about general pop structure

Most populations show evidence of resistance to at least one family of insecticides, with nn samples carrying at least one potential resistance allele.

As expected, markers in the Vgsc gene for target-site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides were widespread, however we also show that many individuals also carry potential markers for 
metabolic resistance to pyrethoids.

These results can inform the roll-out of pyrethoid plus cytochrome P450 synergist bednets, which provide increased protection in the presence of pyrethroid metabolic resistance, and
demonstrate the power of these genomic datasets in the fight against malaria.

By continually enlarging this open dataset of mosquito genomes, we aim to accelerate research into medically important aspects of vector evolution and the development of an insecticide
resistance monitoring framework required for malaria elimination.
