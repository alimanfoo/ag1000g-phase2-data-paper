%% Population sampling
\subsection*{Population Sampling}


%
In Phase 2 of the AG1000G Project we sequenced the genomes from 655 \textit{Anopheles gambiae} individuals, 283 \textit{An. coluzzii} and 204 individuals of "unknown" species (@@should we say something about "unknown" here?)(1142 individuals in total).
%
The project now spans 16 populations of mosquitoes, sampled from 13 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1; Table 1). 
%
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were identified after read alignement to the AgamP3 reference genome \cite{Holt2002} (cite Vectorbase @@) (Methods @@).
%
After rigorous data quality control, utilising whole genome data from parents and siblings of lab-colony experimental crosses to quantify error rates (Methods @@), we identified a total of 139.7Mbp 
(60.6\% of the reference genome) that were accessible and from which SNPs data could be taken for analysis of population variation (Methods @@).
%
Analysis of the AG1000G Phase 1 sequencing data found slightly more genome accessible, 141.5Mbp (61.4\% of the reference genome - \cite{Ag1000gConsortium2017}), but this was expected as mendelian errors in the offspring of lab 
crosses were used to evaluate accessibility, and more crosses contributed to this evaluation in Phase 2 (11 crosses were used compared to four).
%
We identified 57,837,885 high-quality SNPs, of which 24\% were classed as multi-allelic (three or more alleles), generating an average of one variant allele every 1.9 bases of accessible genome 
(decreasing from every 2.2 bases in Phase 1 - \cite{Ag1000gConsortium2017}), the addition of 377 Phase 2 samples added over five million SNPs to the AG1000G data set.

%% Difference from reference
\subsection*{AgamP4 reference genome is equally similar to both species in the study}

The genomes of \textit{An. coluzzii} and \textit{An. gambiae} samples were similarly diverged from the reference genome used for alignment, AgamP4 \cite{Holt2002}, indicating that comparisons can be made between the two species based on our results (Fig. \ref{refdiff}a).
%
The similarity in levels of divergence reflect the mixed ancestry of the PEST strain from which the reference genome was derived \cite{Holt2002}.
%
An exception to this is the pericentromeric region of chromosome X, a known genomic region of divergence between the two species \cite{Ag1000gConsortium2017}, where the reference genome is more similar to \textit{An. coluzzii} than to \textit{An. gambiae}.
%
This similarity to \textit{An. coluzzii} on the X chromosome may be due to the history of artificial selection for the X-linked pink eye mutation in the reference strain \cite{Holt2002}, as this originated in the \textit{An. coluzzii} parent it may have led to the removal of any \textit{An. gambiae} ancestry in this region.
%
Reductions in divergence from the reference genome in regions of low recombination are apparent in the centromeres and telomeres, as well as in the large 2La polymorphic inversion in both species \cite{coluzzi2002} (Fig. \ref{refdiff}b \& c). 
%
All analyses of geographical population structure were conducted on euchromatic regions of Chromosome 3, which avoids regions of polymorphic inversions, reduced recombination and unequal divergence from the reference genome \cite{Ag1000gConsortium2017}.

Comparing three populations of \textit{An. coluzzii} (b) or \textit{An. gambiae} (c) highlights the strong effect of the 2La chromosomal inversion on the accumulation of genetic variation.}

\subsection*{1. Population sampling}

%
Ag1000g Phase 2 mosquitoes were collected from natural populations at 33 sites from 23
geographical locations in 13 sub-Saharan African countries. 
%
Samples have been grouped into 16 populations based on collection country and species (@@TODO Figure 1, Table 1).
%
Throughout, we use species nomenclature following Coetzee \textit{et al}. \cite{Coetzee2013};	
%
prior to	 Coetzee	 \textit{et al}., \textit{An. gambiae} was known as \textit{An. gambiae sensu stricto} (S form) and \textit{An. coluzzii} was known as \textit{An. gambiae sensu stricto} (M form).
%
Details of the eighteen collection sites novel to Ag1000g Phase 2 (dates, collection and DNA extraction methods) can be found in the Methods section below \textbf{1.1 Novel Phase 2 natural populations}.
%
Information pertaining to the collection of samples released as part of Ag1000g Phase 1 can be found in the supplementary methods of Ag1000g Consortium (2017) \cite{Ag1000gConsortium2017}.
%
Unless otherwise stated, the DNA extraction method used for the collections described below was Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{1.1 Novel Phase 2 natural populations}
%
\textbf{C\^{o}te d'Ivoire (CIcol)}: Tiassal\'{e} (-4.823, 5.898) is located in the evergreen forest zone of southern C\^{o}te d'Ivoire.
%
The primary agricultural activity is rice cultivation in irrigated fields.
%
High malaria transmission occurs during the rainy seasons, between May and November.
%
Samples were collected as larvae from irrigated rice fields by dipping between May and Septermber 2012.
%
All larvae were reared to adults and females preserved over silica for DNA extraction.
%
Specimens from this site were all \textit{An. coluzzii}, determined by PCR assay \cite{Santolamazza2008}
%%

\textbf{Bioko Island - Equatorial Guinea (GQgam)}: Collections were performed during the rainy season in September, 2002 by overnight CDC light traps in Sacriba of Bioko island (8.7, 3.7).
%
Specimens were stored dry on silica gel before DNA extraction.
%
Specimens contributed from this site were \textit{An. gambiae} females, genotype determined by two assays \cite{Scott1993, Santolamazza2004}.
%
All specimens had the 2L\textsuperscript{+a}/2L\textsuperscript{+a} karyotype as determined by the molecular PCR diagnostics \cite{White2007}. 
%
These mosquitoes represent a population that inhabited Bioko Island before a comprehensive malaria control intervention initiated in February 2004 \cite{Sharp2007}. 
%
After the intervention \textit{An. gambiae} was declining, and more recently almost only \textit{An. coluzzii} can be found \cite{Overgaard2012}.
%%

%
\textbf{Mayotte Island - France (FRgam)}: Samples were collected as larvae during March-April 2011 in temporary pools by dipping, in Bouyouni (-12.738, 45.143), M'Tsamboro Forest Reserve (-12.703, 45.081), Combani (-12.779, 45.143), Mtsanga Charifou (-12.991, 45.156), Karihani Lake forest reserve (-12.797, 45.122), and Sada (-12.852, 45.104) in Mayotte island.
%
Larvae were stored in 80\% ethanol prior to DNA extraction. 
%
All specimens contributed to Ag1000G phase 2 were \textit{An. gambiae} \cite{Santolamazza2004} with the standard 2L\textsuperscript{+a}/2L\textsuperscript{+a} or inverted 2L\textsuperscript{a}/2L\textsuperscript{a} karyotype as determined by the molecular PCR diagnostics \cite{White2007}.
%
The samples were identified as males or females by the sequencing read coverage of the X chromosome using LookSeq \cite{Manske2009}.
%%

%
\textbf{The Gambia (GM)}: Indoor resting female mosquitoes were collected by pyrethrum spray catch from four hamlets around Njabakunda (-15.90, 13.55), North Bank Region, The Gambia between August and October 2011.
%
The four hamlets were Maria Samba Nyado, Sare Illo Buya, Kerr Birom Kardo, and Kerr Sama Kuma; all are within 1 km of each other.
%
This is an area of unusually high hybridization rates between \textit{An. gambiae s.s.} and \textit{An. coluzzii} \cite{Caputo2008, Nwakanma2013}.
%
Njabakunda village is approximately 30 km to the west of Farafenni town and 4 km away from the Gambia River.
%
The vegetation is a mix of open savannah woodland and farmland.
%
With apparent high gene-flow in the region, it is problematic to assign species to these samples.
%%

%
\textbf{Ghana (GHcol/GHgam)}: Twifo Praso (5.609, -1.549) a peri-urban community located in semi-deciduous forest in the Central Region of Ghana.
%
It is an extensive agricultural area characterised by small-scale (vegetable growing) and large-scale commercial farms such as oil palm and cocoa plantations.
%
Mosquito samples were collected as larvae from puddles near farms between September and October, 2012.
%
Madina (5.668,	-0.219) is suburb of Accra within a coastal savanna zone of Ghana. 
%
It is an urban community characterised by myriad vegetable-growing areas.
%
The vegetation consists of mainly grassland interspersed with dense short thickets often less than 5 m high with a few trees.
%
Specimens were sampled from puddles near roadsides and farms between October and December 2012.
%
Takoradi (4.912, -1.774) is the capital city of Western Region of Ghana.
%
It is an urban community located in the coastal savanna zone.
%
Mosquito samples were collected from puddles near road construction and farms between August and September 2012.
%
Koforidua (6.094, -0.261) is a capital city of Eastern Region of Ghana and is located in semi-deciduous forest. 
%
It is an urban community characterized by numerous small-scale vegetable farms. 
%
Samples were collected from puddles near road construction and farms between August and September 2012.
%
Larvae from all collection sites were reared to adults and females preserved over silica for DNA extraction.
%
Both \textit{An. gambiae} and \textit{An. coluzzii} were collected from these sites, determined by PCR assay \cite{Santolamazza2008}.
%%

%
\textbf{Guinea-Bissau (GW)}: Mosquitoes were collected in October 2010 using indoor CDC light traps, in the village of Safim (11.957, -15.649), ca. 11 km north of Bissau city, the capital of the country.
%
Malaria is hyperendemic in the region and transmitted by members of the Anopheles gambiae complex (Vicente et al., 2017).
%
\textit{Anopheles arabiensis, An. melas, A. coluzzii} and \textit{A. gambiae}, as well as hybrids between the latter two species, are known to occur in the region \cite{Gordicho2014, Vicente2017}.
%
Mosquitoes were preserved individually on 0.5ml micro-tubes filled with silica gel and cotton. DNA extraction was performed by a phenol-chloroform protocol \cite{Donnelly1999}.
%
Guinea-Bissau is another region where defining species is problematic (Vicente), so no species has been assigned here.

\subsection*{2 Whole genome sequencing}

%
Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
%
Paired-end multiplex libraries were prepared using the manufacturer's protocol, with the exception that genomic DNA was fragmented using Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics rather than nebulization.
%
Multiplexes comprised 12 tagged individual mosquitoes and three lanes of sequencing were generated for each multiplex to even out variations in yield between sequencing runs.
%
Cluster generation and sequencing were undertaken per the manufacturer's protocol for paired-end 100 bp sequence reads with insert size in the range 100-200 bp.
%
Target coverage was 30X per individual.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{?.? SNP validation}

We used 11 laboratory crosses to estimate the error associated with genotyping from short reads. 
%
We defined errors at sites where given confident parental genotypes and mendelian inheritance, the expected genotypes of progeny are known. 
%
At loci where both parents are homozygous for the reference or alternate allele, we expect the progeny to be homozygous for the reference or alternate allele accordingly.
%
When one parent is homozygous for the reference allele, and the other the alternate allele we expect all progeny to be heterozygous. 
%
Therefore we can generate ascertainment error estimates for heterozygous, homozygous reference and homozygous alternate genotypes.
%
To meet the confidence threshold for homozygous calls, both parents must have 30x coverage, and have no discordant reads.
%
%
Sites are considered erroneously called if at least 10 progeny have genotypes called at that locus, and one or more do not match the expected genotype. 
%
Sites are considered correctly called if at least 10 progeny have genotypes called and all match the expected genotype. 
%
Crosses had between 14-20 progeny, except cross 61-3 (n=8) which was excluded from this analysis.
%
%
Error in ascertainment rates are computed over each cross, and errors are reported as the median over all 11 crosses. 
%
%
Raw error rates were 0.72 (0.39, 2.44) for heterozygotes, 0.07 (0.03, 0.25) for homozygous reference calls, and 0.82 (0.37, 1.47) for homozygous alternate calls. 
%
Following variant filtering via QC thresholds and the accessibility map these values dropped to 0.26 (0.15, 1.23) for heterozygotes, 0.02 (0.01, 0.12) for homozygous reference calls, and 0.80 (0.31, 1.51) for homozygous alternate calls.
