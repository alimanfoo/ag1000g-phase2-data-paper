\subsection*{Field population sampling}

%
\textbf{C\^{o}te d'Ivoire (CI)}: Tiassal\'{e} (-4.822930, 5.898390) is located in the evergreen forest zone of southern C\^{o}te d'Ivoire.
%
The primary agricultural activity is rice cultivation in irrigated fields.
%
High malaria transmission occurs during the rainy seasons, between May and November.
%
Samples were collected as larvae from irrigated rice fields by dipping between May and Septermber 2012.
%
All larvae were reared to adults and females preserved over silica for DNA extraction using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).
%
Specimens from this site were all \textit{An. coluzzii}
%%

%
\textbf{Equatorial Guinea (GQgam)}: Collections were performed during the rainy season in September, 2002 by overnight CDC light traps in Sacriba of Bioko island (8.700000, 3.700000).
%
Specimens were stored dry on silica gel and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy kit.
%
Specimens contributed from this site were \textit{An. gambiae} females, genotype determined by two assays (Scott et al. 1993; Santolamazza et al. 2004).
%
All specimens had the 2L\textsuperscript{+a}/2L\textsuperscript{+a} karyotype as determined by the molecular PCR diagnostics (White et al. 2007). 
%
These mosquitoes represent a population that inhabited Bioko Island before a comprehensive malaria control intervention initiated in February 2004 (Sharp et al. 2007). 
%
After the intervention \textit{An. gambiae} was declining, and more recently almost only \textit{An. coluzzii} can be found (Overgaard et al. 2012).
