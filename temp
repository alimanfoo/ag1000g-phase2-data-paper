Following \cite{AG1000G@@ phase 1 - Supp Text 3.5. Variant filtering and annotation}, to reduce the number of false SNP discoveries, we applied the following SNP filters. 
%
We filtered any SNP that occurred at a genome position classified as inaccessible as described in the section on genome accessibility above, removing SNPs with evidence for excessively high or low coverage or ambiguous alignment. 
%
We then applied additional filters using variant annotations produced by GATK based on an analysis of Mendelian error in all 11 crosses present in phase 2 and Ti/Tv ratio similar to that described above for the genome accessibility analysis.
%
We filtered any SNP that failed any of the following criteria: QD < 5; FS > 100; ReadPosRankSum < -8; BaseQRankSum < -50.

%
Of 95,335,499 SNPs reported in the raw callset, 52,525,957 passed all quality filters. 
%
Prior to filtering, the rate of Mendelian error in genotype calls expected to be heterozygous in the progeny of the crosses (parents 0/0 x 1/1 or vice versa) 
was between 13.0-21.7% depending on the cross. 
%
After filtering, the Mendelian error rate was 0.3-0.9%.
%
To produce an analysis-ready VCF file for each chromosome arm, we first removed all non-SNP variants. 
%
We then removed genotype calls for individuals excluded by the sample QC analysis described above, 
and then removed any variants that were no longer variant after excluding individuals. 
%
We then added INFO annotations with genome accessibility metrics and added FILTER annotations per the criteria defined above. 
%
Finally, we added INFO annotations with information about functional consequences of mutations using SNPEFF version 4.1b (Cingolani et al. 2012).
