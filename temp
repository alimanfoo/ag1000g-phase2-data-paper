Analysis of population structure in the nine AG1000G Phase 1 populations revealed medically
important demographic features such a levels of differentiation between populations and 
movement of insecticide resistance mutations across Sub-Saharan Africa (@@Ref). 
Here we revisit population structure analyses but include the seven populations novel
to Phase 2.

Of particular importance to the Phase 2 release are the two new An. coluzzii populations, 
Cote d'Ivoire (CIcol) and Ghana (GHcol). In Phase 1, only two of the nine populations 
belonged to this species and these, Burkina Faso (BFcol) and Angola (AOcol) appeared quite 
different to each other in principal component analysis (PCA), doubleton sharing and FST, 
making conclusions about the population structure of this major malaria vector problematic
and the relationship to An. gambiae (sister species) difficult to investigate.






Of particular interest are the three Phase 2 An. Coluzzii populations

s	both	can	play	a	role	in	the	spread	of	medically-
important	variants,	including	insecticide	resistance	mutations.
