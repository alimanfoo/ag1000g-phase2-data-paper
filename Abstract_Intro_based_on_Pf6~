Phase 2 


**Abstract**

MalariaGen in a data sharing network that enables groups around the world to the use genomic tools to study malaria disease and transmission.

Here we describe a new release of curated whole genome variation data on 1142 malaria vector mosquito samples from 16 populations in 13 sub-Saharan African countries.

High-quality genotype calls on ~58 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were produced using a standardised analysis pipeline.

~~something about general pop structure

Most populations show evidence of resistance to at least one family of insecticides, with nn samples carrying at least one potential resistance allele.
